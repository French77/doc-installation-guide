How to make a bootable DVD
--------------------------

Optical discs are slow and burning to disc is prone to errors.

.. note::
	To prevent issues, burn at the lowest possible speed.

.. warning::
	Burn the content of the ISO onto the DVD, not the ISO file itself. When finished, your DVD should contain directories such as ``boot`` and ``casper``, it shouldn't be an empty DVD containing an .iso file.

In Linux
````````
Install and use ``xfburn``.

In Windows
``````````
Right-click the ISO file and select :menuselection:`Burn disk image`.

To make sure the ISO was burned without any errors, select :menuselection:`Verify disc after burning`.

In Mac OS
`````````
Right-click the ISO file and select :menuselection:`Burn Disk Image to Disc`.
